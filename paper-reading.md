## Summary
The paper seeks to highlight the need to recontextualise the dicsussion about fairness in NLP in the context of India. It emphasises how different India is in compasision wit the "western" world, which arise from the scale of diversity present in the country. The diverse nature of India leads to discrimination occuring upon various axes, this paper seeks to highlight the fairness of NLP by testing them against the same axes. The authors curated a dataset consisting of human annotated data about stereotypes present in Indian society. They test the NLPs performance in terms of fairness with different axis, and comparing it to the dataset.

## Strengths
1. Testing and proving superiority of indic NLPs when used in an indian context.
2. Re-contextualisation is done properly to an indian context by taking into account the factors unique to India.
3. The axeses assessed were properly selected and assessed given the constraints of the research agenda.

## Weaknesses
1. FOcus on Engligh specific NLP models while tring to analyze Indian context.
2. The identity terms associated with the axes could have been chosen better.
3. The question of "Do you think this stereotype is widely held by society?" may cause the test subjects to not think critically and give incorrect predictions.

## Improvements
1. Translate and perform tests on indic NLPs
2. Curate dataset with more than just 2 axes
3. Get a larger pool of annotators and have them answer the question from their point of view rather than asking them about society's point of view.
